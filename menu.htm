                             <p>
                          Yoga is a great way to work on your flexibility and strength. Just about everyone can do it, too -- it's not just for people who can touch their toes or want to meditate.
                         <br>
                         Some types of yoga are about relaxation. In others, you move more. Most types focus on learning poses, called asanas. They also usually include attention to breathing.
                            </p>
                                                 <br>
                              <h2> Yoga for Flexibility</h4>
                                  <p>
                             Yoga poses work by stretching your muscles. They can help you move better and feel less stiff or tired.
                              <br>
                                  At any level of yoga, you'll probably start to notice benefits soon. In one study, people improved their flexibility by up to 35% after only 8 weeks of yoga.
                                 </p><br>
                                 <h2>Strike a Pose for Strength</h2>
                                <p>Some styles of yoga, such as ashtanga and power yoga, are very physical. Practicing one of these styles will help you improve muscle tone.

                                 But even less vigorous styles of yoga, such as Iyengar or hatha, can provide strength and endurance benefits.
            
                                 Many of the poses, such as downward dog, upward dog, and the plank pose, build upper-body strength. The standing poses, especially if you hold them for several long breaths, build strength in your hamstrings, quadriceps, and abs. Poses that strengthen the lower back include upward dog and the chair pose.
            
                             When done right, nearly all poses build core strength in the deep abdominal muscles.</p>

                    <br><br><br><p>Yoga is a practice that connects the body, breath, and mind. It uses physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation to improve overall health. Yoga was developed as a spiritual practice thousands of years ago. Today, most Westerners do yoga for exercise or to reduce stress.
                      <br><br>Yoga's origins can be traced to northern India over 5,000 years ago. The word yoga was first mentioned in ancient sacred texts called the Rig Veda. The Vedas are a set of four ancient sacred texts written in Sanskrit. The Rig Veda is the earliest amongst the vedas and is a collection of over a thousand hymns and mantras in ten chapters known as mandalas, which were used by Vedic age priests. Yoga was refined and developed by Rishis (sages) who documented their practices and beliefs in the Upanishads, a huge work containing over 200 scriptures.
                      <br><br>
                      A great Indian sage and yoga master, Sri Aurobindo says yoga is a methodical effort toward self-perfection through developing your talent potential on the physical, vital, mental, intellectual, and spiritual levels. And the most fundamental step you can take toward expanding the limits of your consciousness is to gain mastery over your mind.
                      <br><br>
                      Therefore, yoga is an extraordinary spiritual science of self-development and self-realization that shows us how to develop our full potential in our many-sided lives. It was first devised by the rishis and sages of ancient India and has been maintained by a stream of living teachers ever since, who have  continually adapted this science to every generation.
                      <br><br>
                      Yoga’s integrative approach brings deep harmony and unshakable balance to body and mind in order to awaken our latent capacity for a higher consciousness that is the true purpose of human evolution.  The many methods of yoga spans a vast range from physical postures to breathing practices and meditation, all based upon a philosophy of consciousness and natural way of life.

                    <h2 id=asan>Asanas</h2>
                    <p>Asana is the physical practice of yoga poses. In addition to referring broadly to the physical aspect of yoga, asana can also be used to describe a particular pose, as in, "The handstand is an asana that is really hard for me," or "This flow consists of a series of standing asanas."
                    <br><br>
                    What most people call yoga could more specifically be called asana. Yoga has eight limbs. Besides asana, yoga also encompasses pranayama (breathing exercises), dhyana (meditation), yamas (codes of social conduct), niyamas (self-observances), pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses), dharana (concentration), and samadhi (bliss).</p>

                <h2>Benefits of Asanas</h2>
                <p>
                    Asanas are performed to improve flexibility, strength, and balance.1 Asanas—or yoga poses—help the body's joints , ligaments, and muscles strengthen through movement. A regular yoga practice can, over time, increase flexibility and mobility, lubricating the spine and alignment to aid in everyday activity.
                    <br><br>
                    All yoga poses are performed in conjunction and in sync with the breath, such as Ujjayi breath. When you combine breathing techniques and focus, these asanas can also help relieve stress and anxiety. The poses are not meant to simply be physical exercises but rather used holistically as a mind-body practice to improve physical, mental, and spiritual health.
                    <br><br>
                    A regular asana practice can also help in strengthening the immune system and in improving blood circulation throughout the body. Through a dedicated practice and with time, the body can experience noticeable improvements and benefits from asanas.

                        <li>Fruit, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils and beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat and brown rice).

                        </li>
                        <li>At least 400 g (i.e. five portions) of fruit and vegetables per day, excluding potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots.</li>
                    <li>Less than 10% of total energy intake from free sugars, which is equivalent to 50 g (or about 12 level teaspoons) for a person of healthy body weight consuming about 2000 calories per day, but ideally is less than 5% of total energy intake for additional health benefits. Free sugars are all sugars added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, as well as sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates</li>
                    <li>Less than 30% of total energy intake from fats (1, 2, 3). Unsaturated fats (found in fish, avocado and nuts, and in sunflower, soybean, canola and olive oils) are preferable to saturated fats (found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee and lard) and trans-fats of all kinds, including both industrially-produced trans-fats (found in baked and fried foods, and pre-packaged snacks and foods, such as frozen pizza, pies, cookies, biscuits, wafers, and cooking oils and spreads) and ruminant trans-fats (found in meat and dairy foods from ruminant animals, such as cows, sheep, goats and camels). It is suggested that the intake of saturated fats be reduced to less than 10% of total energy intake and trans-fats to less than 1% of total energy intake (5). In particular, industrially-produced trans-fats are not part of a healthy diet and should be avoided.</li>
                    <li>Less than 5  g of salt (equivalent to about one teaspoon) per day (8).  Salt should be iodized.</li>
